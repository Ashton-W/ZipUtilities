### Test files for zipping/unzipping
As a part of unit testing, Aesop's Fables and Maniac Mansion are both used for unit testing.  Neither has a copyright anymore and can be freely be distributed including the unorthodox use as test files for unit testing zip archiving and unarchiving.

### MiniZip
MiniZip 1.1 is a dependency of ZipUtilities.  However, given that the latest version of MiniZip was from 2010, ZipUtilities will modify MiniZip to version 1.2 in order to address 2 concerns:

1. compiler and static analysis warnings
2. dated coding style and syntax
